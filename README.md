# Google Codejam 2019 Round 1 Solutions

Solved 3 problems and managed to proceed to the next round. Didn't participate in Round 1A/1B/1C though.

Might not comply to the clean code convention and might not be the optimal solution, but it worked!

## How to run

To compile:

```
$ g++ -o bin/<program_name> <file_name>.cpp -std=c++11
```

To run program with default test cases:

```
$ ./bin/<program_name> < <program_name>.in
```

## Example

Example Run

```
$ g++ -o bin/rivalLydia rivalLydia.cpp -std=c++11        
$ ./bin/rivalLydia < rivalLydia.in
```

Example Output

```
Case #1: ES
Case #2: SSEEESES
```
